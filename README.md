# Pig-Game

## Description

Pig is a simple and fun dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their gained score for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn.

## Rules

1. Players take turns to roll a single die.
2. On each turn, the player can roll the die as many times as they wish.
3. Each roll adds the result to a running total for the turn.
4. If the player rolls a 1:
   - They score nothing for that turn.
   - It becomes the next player's turn.
5. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the turn continues.
6. The player can choose to "hold" at any point:
   - The turn total is added to their overall score.
   - It becomes the next player's turn.
7. The first player to reach 100 or more points wins the game.

## Interface
